<h2>  Hello, thank you for stopping by my profile. </h2>
<p>
About me? I have been in the software engineering field for more than 4 years. I like system development specially in backend and cloud infrastructure side. Apart from that, I also have experience working on frontend development. 

Currently, I am working as a system engineer at Business Architects inc. And for hobby I love learning new languages. I have Bengali, English, Japanese and Hindi language skills. I also have good business-level communication skills both in English and Japanese. Next, I am onto the Spanish language.

As a system engineer, I have experience working from in-house systems to client systems. I do have experience in providing security support for customers on server-side systems. I have completed having AWS solutions architect associate and I am aiming for the solutions architect professional as well.

If you have any queries please feel free to contact me.
Have a nice time ahead.
</p>
